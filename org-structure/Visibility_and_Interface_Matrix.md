# Strategic Framework: Visibility and Interface Matrix
**Perspective:** Front-of-House vs. Back-of-House Economics

## 1. Executive Summary: The Interface Paradox
Modern software companies fail not because of bad code, but because of poor "translation." The **Visibility and Interface Matrix** categorizes the organization based on their proximity to the end-user. Misalignment here leads to features that no one wants or technical debt that no one understands.

## 2. The Visibility Spectrum
We divide the organization into three critical interface layers.

### A. Front-of-House (External Facing)
*   **Roles:** Product Manager, Solutions Architect, Customer Success Manager (CSM), Technical Support Engineer, UX Researcher.
*   **Core Competency:** Empathy, Market Psychology, and External Communication.
*   **Impact:** They define the "Perceived Value" of the brand.

### B. Back-of-House (Internal Facing)
*   **Roles:** Backend Engineer, DevOps Engineer, DBA, SRE, Software Architect, Data Engineer.
*   **Core Competency:** Logic, Systemic Thinking, and Computational Efficiency.
*   **Impact:** They define the "Actual Reliability" and Scale of the product.

### C. The Bridge (Translation Layer)
*   **Roles:** Technical Product Manager (TPM), Engineering Manager (EM), Technical Writer, UI Designer, Testing Architect.
*   **Core Competency:** Bi-lingual capability (Business-to-Technical).
*   **Impact:** They are the "API" of the organization, ensuring that Back-of-House reality matches Front-of-House promises.

## 3. Operational Nuance: The Feedback Loop
The greatest organizational risk is the "Isolation Gap," where Back-of-House engineers lose context of the user, leading to "Gold Plating"—building complex systems for problems the user doesn't have. Conversely, Front-of-House roles may promise features that violate the fundamental laws of the system's architecture.

## 4. Consultant Recommendations
1.  **Mandatory Rotation:** Implement "Engineering Ride-alongs" where Back-of-House engineers sit in on Customer Success calls twice a quarter.
2.  **The "Translation" Tax:** Acknowledge that Bridge roles (TPMs/EMs) are non-negotiable at scale. Without them, the Front and Back of the house will eventually speak different languages.
3.  **Direct-to-Metal Support:** Allow Tech Support Engineers a direct (but governed) escalation path to Backend Engineers to ensure that "Front-of-House" fires are extinguished by "Back-of-House" fixes.

## 5. Key Success Metrics (KPIs)
*   **Translation Latency:** The time it takes for a user-reported pain point to be converted into a technical ticket.
*   **Roadmap Realization Rate:** The percentage of "promised" features that were technically feasible and delivered on time.
*   **Churn Correlation:** Do Back-of-House stability issues (Uptime) correlate directly with Front-of-House churn?
