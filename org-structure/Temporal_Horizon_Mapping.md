# Strategic Framework: Temporal Horizon Mapping
**Perspective:** The "Time-Traveler" View of Product Longevity
**Author:** Subu (Principal Strategy Consultant)

## 1. Executive Summary: The Conflict of Time
Organizations often fail because they focus entirely on the **Present** while ignoring the **Future**, or vice-versa. The **Temporal Horizon Mapping** framework ensures that the company is simultaneously maintaining its legacy, winning the current market, and preparing for the next disruption.

## 2. The Temporal Horizons

### A. The Historians (The Past: H0)
*   **Roles:** Tech Support, Technical Writer, DBA (Archives), Security (Patching).
*   **Focus:** Sustainability, Documentation, and Incident Post-Mortems.
*   **Objective:** Prevent the past from dragging down the present.

### B. The Operators (The Present: H1)
*   **Roles:** Frontend, Backend, QA, DevOps, Engineering Manager.
*   **Focus:** Sprint Velocity, Bug Fixes, and Current Quarter Deliverables.
*   **Objective:** Win the current market.

### C. The Prophets (The Future: H2/H3)
*   **Roles:** Product Manager (Long-term Strategy), Software Architect, Data Scientist, UX Researcher, Cloud Architect.
*   **Focus:** Scalability, R&D, Market Evolution, and Emerging Tech.
*   **Objective:** Ensure the company isn't disrupted in 18 months.

## 3. Operational Nuance: The Resource Trap
Most companies over-allocate to **Operators** (80%) and starve the **Prophets** (10%) and **Historians** (10%). This creates "Technical Debt Bankruptcy" (too much past baggage) or "Kodak Failure" (being replaced by a future technology).

## 4. Consultant Recommendations
1.  **Enforce the 70/20/10 Rule:** Allocate 70% of headcount to the Present (Operators), 20% to the Future (Prophets), and 10% to the Past (Historians/Cleanup).
2.  **Architectural Veto:** Prophets (Software Architects) must have the power to "veto" an Operator's shortcut if it compromises the 12-month scaling plan.
3.  **Support-to-Prophet Pipeline:** Use data from the Historians (Tech Support) to feed the Prophets (Product Strategy). What is failing in the past is the best indicator of what needs to be reinvented for the future.

## 5. Key Success Metrics (KPIs)
*   **Maintenance vs. Feature Spend:** The ratio of budget spent on "keeping the lights on" (Past) vs. "new value" (Present/Future).
*   **Technical Debt Interest:** The amount of time the Present team spends fixing legacy bugs.
*   **Prototype Conversion Rate:** How many R&D "Future" projects actually move into the "Present" roadmap.
