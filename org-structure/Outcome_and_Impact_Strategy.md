# Strategic Framework: Outcome and Impact Strategy
**Perspective:** The Executive "Value Creation" View
**Author:** Subu (Principal Strategy Consultant)

## 1. Executive Summary: The Budgetary Alignment
From a Board of Directors perspective, roles are not defined by their titles, but by the type of **Economic Outcome** they produce. The **Outcome and Impact Strategy** allows leadership to allocate capital effectively across Innovation, Scaling, and Risk Mitigation.

## 2. The Impact Taxonomy
We categorize the 27 roles based on their primary contribution to the company's bottom line.

### A. Builders (The Value Creators)
*   **Roles:** Frontend, Backend, Mobile, Data Scientist, UI Designer.
*   **Economic Impact:** They create the "Inventory." Every line of code they write is a potential asset to be sold.
*   **Focus:** Innovation and Feature Velocity.

### B. Scalers (The Force Multipliers)
*   **Roles:** SRE, DevOps, Software Architect, Testing Architect, ProdOps.
*   **Economic Impact:** They provide the "Operating Leverage." They ensure that a 10x increase in users does not require a 10x increase in headcount.
*   **Focus:** Efficiency and Systems Optimization.

### C. Guardians (The Capital Preservers)
*   **Roles:** Security Engineer, QA Engineer, DBA, Accessibility Specialist.
*   **Economic Impact:** They protect against "Wealth Destruction." One security breach or a lawsuit for non-compliance (a11y) can wipe out years of "Builder" value.
*   **Focus:** Risk Mitigation and Compliance.

### D. Translators (The Revenue Accelerators)
*   **Roles:** Technical Writer, Technical Support, Customer Success.
*   **Economic Impact:** They ensure "Customer Realization." They turn a technical product into a business solution that the customer is willing to keep paying for.
*   **Focus:** Adoption and Retention.

## 3. Operational Nuance: The Equilibrium
A company with only **Builders** will eventually crash due to poor scaling. A company with only **Scalers and Guardians** will become a stagnant bureaucracy that loses to faster competitors. The "Golden Ratio" of these roles changes as a company matures from Seed to IPO.

## 4. Consultant Recommendations
1.  **Rebalance by Lifecycle:** In early stages, over-index on **Builders** (80%). In growth stages, aggressively hire **Scalers** (30%). In mature enterprise stages, ensure **Guardians** have veto power (20%).
2.  **Avoid the "Feature Factory" Trap:** Don't measure Scalers by "Lines of Code." Measure them by "System Stability under Load" and "Deployment Velocity."
3.  **Empower the Guardians:** Ensure that Security and QA report to a different executive line than the Builders to prevent "speed at the cost of safety."

## 5. Key Success Metrics (KPIs)
*   **Innovation Rate:** Percentage of budget spent on Builders vs. Maintenance.
*   **Unit Cost of Scale:** The cost of infrastructure per active user (Managed by Scalers).
*   **Total Cost of Risk:** The projected cost of compliance and security incidents (Managed by Guardians).
