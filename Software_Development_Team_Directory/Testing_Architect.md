# Testing Architect

## Role
The Testing Architect is a high-level individual contributor responsible for the overall quality strategy of the organization. They don't just write tests; they design the entire infrastructure, frameworks, and cultural practices that ensure software is released with zero regressions.

## Responsibilities
- **Framework Selection:** Evaluating and choosing the best-in-class tools for E2E, Integration, and Unit testing (e.g., Playwright vs. Cypress).
- **Test Infrastructure:** Designing scalable environments where thousands of tests can run in parallel (using Docker/Kubernetes).
- **Strategy & Governance:** Defining what "Quality" looks like (e.g., 80% coverage mandate, mandatory linting rules).
- **Performance & Security Testing:** Integrating non-functional testing into the standard CI/CD pipeline.
- **Mentorship:** Training QA Engineers and SDETs on best practices for maintainable test code.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Advanced E2E:** Playwright, Cypress, Selenium Grid.
- **Contract Testing:** Pact.io, Postman Collections.
- **Cloud Testing:** BrowserStack, Sauce Labs, LambdaTest.
- **Visual Testing:** Applitools, Percy.io.
- **Reporting:** Allure Report, ReportPortal.io.
