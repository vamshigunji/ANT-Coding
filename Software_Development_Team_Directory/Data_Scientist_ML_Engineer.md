# Data Scientist / ML Engineer

## Role
This role involves extracting insights from data and building predictive models. Data Scientists focus on analysis and experimentation, while ML Engineers focus on the productionization and scaling of those models.

## Responsibilities
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Finding patterns and anomalies in large datasets.
- **Model Training:** Selecting algorithms and tuning parameters to predict outcomes.
- **A/B Testing:** Design experiments to see which feature performs better.
- **MLOps:** Setting up pipelines for continuous training and deployment of AI models.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), R.
- **Deep Learning:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras.
- **Notebooks:** Jupyter, Google Colab.
- **MLOps:** MLflow, WandB (Weights & Biases), SageMaker.
- **Vector Databases:** Pinecone, Milvus (for LLM applications).
