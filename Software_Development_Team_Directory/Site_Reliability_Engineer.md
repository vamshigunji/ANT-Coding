- **Incident Management:** Managing "on-call" rotations and performing post-mortems after system failures.
- **Monitoring & Alerting:** Building dashboards that predict failures before they happen.
- **Auto-scaling:** Writing scripts that automatically increase server capacity during traffic spikes.
