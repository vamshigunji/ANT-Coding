# Interaction Designer

## Role
The Interaction Designer focuses on how the product *moves*. They specialize in the behavior of the interface—how it responds to user input and how it transitions between states.

## Responsibilities
- **Motion Design:** Creating animations and micro-interactions (e.g., button loading states, page transitions).
- **Prototyping:** Building complex, interactive prototypes that behave like real software.
- **State Logic:** Defining how the UI changes based on different user conditions or system responses.
- **Accessibility:** Ensuring interactive elements are usable via keyboard, touch, and screen readers.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Advanced Prototyping:** Framer, Protopie, Principle.
- **Motion Graphics:** After Effects (with Lottie for web export).
- **Web Fundamentals:** Basic CSS/JS knowledge (to understand what is technically possible).
